                    <p>Hey all,</p>
                    <p>My name is Anik Chattopadhyay and I am a new graduate student within the Ying Wu College of
                        Computing pursuing a masters degree in Information Systems. I am pursuing this degree in hopes
                        of having a better understanding of best practices during the software development process and
                        being able to communicate with software engineers and core stakeholders during the design
                        process.</p>
                    <p>I graduated from The College of New Jersey in 2018 with a bachelors degree in Mechanical
                        Engineering. A month after graduating I began working at Bloomberg LP as a Data Analyst.
                        Bloomberg LP is a financial software company that connects decision makers to a dynamic network
                        of data, delivering business and financial information, news and insights globally.</p>
                    <p>My role at Bloomberg involves providing programming and application support for the fixed income
                        department, which focuses on internal process improvement, evaluation and testing. My team works
                        to deliver key objectives throughout two-week sprints utilizing a Scrum methodology. The
                        technologies I typically work with include Python, SQL, QlikSense, as well as the Bloomberg
                        technology stack to provide workflow solutions in the form of automation, quality control, and
                        validation. I look forward to learning more about you all and working together throughout this
                        course!</p>

                        <p>Hi everyone,</p>
                        <p>My name is Elio Nicolas. I am a first year graduate student pursuing a masters degree in
                        Information Systems. I am taking on this degree in hopes to prepare myself for a new career in
                        the tech field. Unlike many others, I have very elementary knowledge when in comes to software
                        and system development. This is all new to me so I am looking forward to learning from what this
                        class has to offer but from all of your experiences as well. The reason why I am pursuing this
                        degree because it has been an interest of mine since high school however, I never got the
                        opportunity to pursue my interest. I also plan on applying everything that I learn in my
                        class/degree to my work environment to my best ability.</p>
                        <p>Besides that, I have a BA and MA in Religious Studies and I currently work full time at the
                        headquarters of a church. I am looking forward to this class and this semester. Best of luck to
                        everyone!</p>
                    </p>
