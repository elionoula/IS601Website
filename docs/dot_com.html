            <h1>Dot Com Bubble</h1>
            <p>
                The Dot Com Bubble, also known as the internet bubble, was a rapid rise in U.S. technology stock equity
                valuations fueled by investments in internet-based companies during the bull market in the late 1990s.
                The age of ecommerce had been transformed with new technologies like eBay and Amazon. Amazon was birthed
                in a garage in Seattle by Jeff Bezos, who started out on Wall Street. Amazon was launched in summer of
                1995 around the same time Pierre Omidayar was launching eBay, an auction site on the web.
            </p>

                 style="align-content: center">
            <p>
                Measure of success was immediate for Amazon and eBay because they both were selling tons of items upon
                release. Early success of these companies spread to Wall Street because the companies started putting up
                great numbers quarter after quarter.
                Upon the creation of the internet it took only 4 years before it had 50 millions users. This exponential
                growth was attributed to two key factors, Moore’s Law & Metcalfe’s Law. Moore’s Law is defined as the
                principle that the speed and capability of computers can be expected to double every two years, as a
                result of increases in the number of transistors a microchip can contain. Metcalfe’s Law is defined as
                the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users
                of the system.
            </p>
            <img src="images/law.jpg" height="400" width="600" alt="Laws"
                 style="align-content: center">
            <p>
                In the 1990’s tons of internet companies (Yahoo, Excite, Amazon, etc) went public. Bezos followed the
                mantra “get big fast” because it would allow them to help customers at a faster rate. Public key
                cryptography was an instrumental creation during this time period because it allowed for secured
                ecommerce. The public key infrastructure can be defined as a key cryptographic technology, which is
                widely used in open network-based E-commerce systems. As a foundation for E-commerce security, it
                enhances the security service functionalities, such as authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and
                non-repudiation of the systems.
            </p>
            <img src="images/amazon.jpg" height="400" width="600" alt="Amazon"
                 style="align-content: center">
            <p>
                Meg Whitman was brought into eBay to show Wall Street that the company was legit company for them to
                invest in. The day eBay launched, the price rocketed from $15 per share to $50 per share. Henry Blodget
                said although Amazon was posting huge losses that the share prices would double, he issued a statement
                saying the price would reach $400 in the next year. Amazon’s stock price doubled in a few short weeks
                which would mark the start of the internet bubble. Blodget would later be banned by the SEC because
                incriminating emails were found from him where he highlighted the mass amount of internet companies
                going public were not good companies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The IPOs of Amazon and eBay started a craze of people to create new internet companies in an attempt to
                create similar riches that Jeff and Pierre had achieved. Tons of people wanted to get involved in
                internet companies which spawned the rise of day traders who would buy stocks in the morning and sell
                them later in the day for profits. Wall Street and venture capitalists understood that lots of the new
                companies that were coming up were not valuable, but they did not want to sit by while companies started
                making money and were banking that at least one of the companies would survive and thrive.
            <p>
                Fiber optics also contributed to the bubble because tons of telecommunication companies were attempting
                to provide people with larger bandwidth to operate at quicker frequency. In 1999 the total amount of
                internet companies to go public was 250, this was more than the previous high which was 30 companies in
                1995.
            </p>

                 style="align-content: center">
            <p>
                Wall Street believed the holiday season would bring huge gains to ecommerce companies, and when they
                didnt they began to doubt the “get big fast” mindset that Jeff Bezos had been preaching. In April 2000
                the internet economy brought the nasdaq to fall 355 points, known as black friday. Looking back at the
                Dot Com Bubble people viewed it as a good thing because it paved the way for the internet being scaled
                and expanded via better bandwidth.
