            <h1>Browser Wars</h1>
            <p>
                In the early 1990s, the Web was simply a research network that consisted of a few web pages that
                consisted of numerous lines of text. The internet was for academics, researchers, and scientists. It was
                very useful to those that were using it, but not everyone had the knowledge to use it. That is when <a
                    href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen”>Marc Andreessen</a> decided to make the web
                easier to use by adding audio and visual capabilities to browsing the internet. The product of their
                efforts became the world’s first graphical point-and-click web browser, <a
                    href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)”>Mosaic</a>.
                Andreessen and his colleagues made their software available to the public for free. At that point, the
                internet was no longer an exclusive platform for scientists and programmers, but rather a platform for
                the world. The only thing that Andreessen needed to make a global impact was money.
            </p>
            <img src="images/microsoft0.jpg" height="600" width="400" alt="Microsoft"
                 style="float: right; margin:3px 12px 3px;">
            <p>
                At around the same time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft</a> and <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Bill Gates</a> were tightening their grip on the Web
                and computer
                industry. While the world viewed the internet as a wide-open road with no horizon, Bill Gates and
                Microsoft believed that access to the vast information on the internet should be controlled through the
                Microsoft Network. However, time would prove that things would not be that easy for Microsoft and Bill
                Gates. That is when <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_H._Clark”> Jim Clark </a> reached out
                to Andreessen and his colleagues to found what would be the fastest-growing software company the world
                has ever seen, <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape”>Netscape Communications</a>. The plan
                was to take Mosaic to the next level, and build a browser that was more powerful and dominant. Netscape
                perceived Microsoft as their only competition, and their new browser launched publicly under the name of
                <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator”> Navigator </a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Navigator was an instant success when 90% of the people that were using Mosaic instantly switched over
                to Navigator. Bill Gates and his elves were shocked and worried. Bill Gates realized the need to rectify
                his position and decided to go head to head with Netscape and declared a <i>Browser War</i>. After both
                companies failed to agree to work together, Netscape decided to go public as a company and officially
                became the fastest growing software company on the market. The war between the two companies was public
                and Andreessen was bad-mouthing Microsoft and Bill Gates on the media. So in 1995, Microsoft answered
                back and published a web browser of their own, <a
                    href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer”>Internet Explorer</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Microsoft had vast advantages over Netscape, such as enormous financial resources and reserves of
                talented programmers at their disposal. Microsoft’s main goal was to put Netscape out of business by
                staying a step ahead of the Netscape and their browser. Netscape needed to make a profit so they were
                charging money for their browser, whereas Microsoft had billions of dollars and instead of charging
                money, they were able to give Intenet Explorer away for free, completely integrated into their Windows
                Operating System. In 1997, the “Browser War” was coming to an end when Microsoft launched Internet
                Explorer 4.
            </p>
            <img src="images/justice.jpg" height="300" width="200" alt="Justice"
                 style="float: left; margin:3px 12px 3px;">
            <p>
                With their launch, Microsoft had dominated the market and gained complete control over the browser
                market. Netscape was sold off and bought by AOL and was no longer considered to be a pioneer in software
                development or a threat to Microsoft. Soon enough the browser war ended. Years later, other competitive
                browsers were developed and published but none were considered a threat anymore perhaps because of the
                antitrust lawsuit that was filed against Microsoft and Bill Gates after what had happened between
                Microsoft and Netscape. Microsoft might have won the browser war, but Netscape began a revolution that
                gave hope to companies like Google and other startup companies at the time.
